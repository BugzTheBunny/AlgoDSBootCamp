# Big O - My own cheat sheet.

- `O(1)` - Constant - fastest one.
- `O(log N)` - Logarithmic complexity, used in search algorithms for example.
- `O(n)` - Linear - for example loops, going over N items.
- `O(n log(n))` - Log Linear - normally used in sorting operations.
- `O(n^2)` - Quadratic - every new element will need to be comapred to every 2 elements, for example two nested loops.
- `O(2^n)` - Exponential - recursive algorithms.
- `O(n!)` - Factorial - you add a loop for every element for example.
