# Int Reverse

Given an integer, return an integer that is the reverse ordering of numbers.

* There are many ways to reverte a string, you can checkout the [reversestring](../reversestring/README.md) for it, so we will use a simple one here, because this is not the main purpose of this.

### Examples:
```
reverseInt(15) === 51
reverseInt(981) === 189
reverseInt(500) === 5
reverseInt(-15) === -51
reverseInt(-90) === -9
```
